# CoderDojo HTML 
##Introduction 
This is the base line for the HTML classes that the HTML group are working through. 
The initial purpose is to allow the mentors to have visibility of the topics that are going to be discussed as the sessions go on. 
It is also intended to be a hub for suggesting and validating ideas that may be of interest.
